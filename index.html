					There are a lot of different types of web attacks and vulnerabilities. And because of this many security
					technologies were created. Let's take a quick look at the most common ones:
					· Content security policy (CSP)
					CSP is an added layer of security that helps to detect and mitigate certain types of attacks, including
					Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks.
					· Transport layer security (TLS)
					The Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol is the standard for enabling two networked applications or devices
					to exchange information privately and robustly.
					· HTTPS
					HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure is an encrypted version of the HTTP protocol. It uses SSL or TLS to encrypt
					all communication between a client and a server.
					· HTTP Strict-Transport-Security
					The Strict-Transport-Security: HTTP header lets a website specify that it may only be accessed using HTTPS.
					· Certificate Transparency
					Certificate Transparency is an open framework designed to protect against and monitor for certificate errors.
					· Subresource Integrity
					Subresource Integrity (SRI) is a security feature that enables browsers to verify that resources they fetch
					are delivered without unexpected manipulation. It works by allowing you to provide a cryptographic hash that a
					fetched resource must match
					· CORS
					Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is a mechanism that allows restricted resources on a web page to be
					requested from another domain outside the domain from which the first resource was served. Let’s talk about
					CORS in detail.

				<aside class="notes">
					CORS was originally proposed by Matt Oshry, Brad Porter, and Michael Bodell in 2004, but it was accepted as a
					W3C Recommendation only in 2014. Nowadays, all modern browsers support CORS.

					By default, the same-origin security policy forbids cross-origin access to resources in order to prevent
					attacks such as XSS(Cross-Site Scripting). But CORS gives web servers the ability to interact with other
					resources and do it securely.

				</div>
				<aside class="notes">
					Basic algorithm of CORS is pretty simple. All cross-origin HTTP requests besides GET, HEAD and POST are
					forbidden. If you want to send one of the accessed requests, you have to use standard type-content and
					standard HTTP headers. If these conditions are met, CORS will allow the request. Otherwise, you will get an
					error.
					But what if you want to make different HTTP requests or use custom headers and different type-content? First,
					your browser sends a request to the server. Then the server must respond with the requested data along with an
					ACAO (which stands for Access-Control-Allow-Origin) header indicating the requests from this origin are
					allowed. This algorithm allows using cross-origin requests and keeps it secure and safe.

				<aside class="notes">
					Now I’d like to talk about authentication. Authentication is one of the most important parts of web security.
					We use it on almost every website.
					But how to make authentication both secure and convenient at the same time? On modern web pages you stay
					logged in even after closing the page or shutting down your computer. How is it possible?
					One thing that makes this behavior possible is JWT. JWT or JSON Web Token is an Internet standard for creating
					data with optional signature and optional encryption whose payload holds JSON objects.

				</ol>
				<aside class="notes">
					Scheme of work:
					1) The client is authenticated in the application (for example, using a login and password)
					2) In case of successful authentication, the server sends access and refresh tokens to the client.
					3) When further accessing the server, the client uses an access token. The server checks the token for
					validity and provides the client with access to resources
					4) If the access token becomes invalid, the client sends a refresh token, in response to which the server
					provides two refreshed tokens.
					5) If the refresh token becomes invalid, the client must again go through the authentication process.

				<aside class="notes">
					OAuth (Open Authorization) is an open standard for access delegation, commonly used as a way for Internet
					users to grant websites or applications access to their information on other websites but without giving them
					the passwords. This mechanism is used by companies such as Amazon, Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Twitter to
					permit the users to share information about their accounts with third-party applications or websites.
					Generally, OAuth provides clients a "secure delegated access" to server resources on behalf of a resource
					owner. It specifies a process for resource owners to authorize third-party access to their server resources
					without providing credentials. Designed specifically to work with Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), OAuth
					essentially allows access tokens to be issued to third-party clients by an authorization server, with the
					approval of the resource owner. The third party then uses the access token to access the protected resources
					hosted by the resource server.
